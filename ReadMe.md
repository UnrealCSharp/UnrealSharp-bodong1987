# UnrealSharp
UnrealSharp is a plug-in developed for UnrealEngine 5. Through this plug-in, you can use pure C# to develop UnrealEngine 5 projects.  

## Main Features
* Support C# `Hot Reloading` in non-playing state    
* Supports `.NET 6.0`~`.NET 8.0` [default is `.NET 8.0`], supports `C#12  `
* Supports creating new `Unreal classes`, `Unreal structures`, `Unreal enumerations`, etc. in C#  
* Supports creating new `Unreal properties`, `Unreal functions`, and `Unreal multicast delegates` for C# class.  
* Supports C# classes to `inherit Unreal C++ classes`, which means you can implement your own UObject, UActorComponent, and AActor subclasses in C#   
* Supports `overriding C++` Event functions in C#   
* Support access to `all` C# classes, structures, enumerations, methods, delegates, etc. from Unreal Blueprints  
* Supports Unreal Blueprint classes `inheriting C# classes` and `overriding all C# UFunctions` in blueprints  
* Support `debugging` C# code through `Visual Studio` or `Rider`, and support simultaneous debugging of C++ and C#  
* When the C# code you write does not comply with Unreal Sharp's specifications, you will get a compilation error during the `compilation phase`. At the same time, UnrealSharp will tell you the error type of the `error code`, the code `file` and the `line number`. You can jump directly with a double-click. This No different than a normal C# compilation error.  
* Supports automatically generating corresponding C# binding code for Unreal C++ or Unreal Blueprint [optional]. As long as Unreal's classes, structures, enumerations, functions, etc. can be accessed in blueprints, almost all of them can be accessed in C#.  
* Most C++ APIs are automatically generated as versions based on C# Function Pointers to improve calling speed.  
* This interactive function framework based on C# Function Pointers is public. You can register a new C++ API with the framework if necessary.    
* Automatically align Unreal and C# memory management and object lifetimes so you almost never have to handle anything yourself.  
* The style of C# binding code remains the same as Unreal C++, and there is almost no difference between calling these C++ interfaces and in C++.
* `AOT friendly`, support for AOT has been considered from the initial design.  
* Pure plug-in design, you donâ€™t need to modify any engine source code  
* In addition to the three special projects reserved by the framework, you can add any number of C# projects, and it also supports implementing corresponding Unreal types in these projects.

* &#x2714; : Fully Support
* &#x2716; : Not Support, Not supported means not allowed in C#
Use this type in this form.  
* **conditional** : Conditional support, For example, among structures, only structures that meet the conditions can use fast access, that is, the memory size, layout, attribute type and offset of the C++ structure and the C# structure are exactly the same, and the attribute types also support fast access.
* **partial** : Partially supported,Strings support fast parameter passing, but when the passing method is by reference, fast access is not supported.  

**When there is a parameter type in the function that does not support fast access or the return value does not support fast access, the function call in normal mode will be used, which is slower than fast access.**


## How can I use it?
To use this library, you need these few steps, you can click on the link to get the details, or directly check the [video tutorial list on youtube](#youtube-turtorials):  
1. Install [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) for your development platform  
2. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) [[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has not been tested yet]  
3. Clone or download this project. Copy the Plugins directory and GameScripts directory to your Unreal C++ project (pure Blueprint projects are not supported)  
4. [Prepare UnrealSharp ThirdParty](./Docs/PrepareThirdParty.md)  
5. [Add a dependency on UnrealSharp](./Docs/AddUnrealSharpDependency.md) in Build.cs of your game project
6. Build your Unreal Project and then start UnrealEditor  
7. Export Unreal C++ type database or Unreal Blueprint type database from: Tools>UnrealSharp>Export Database or use console command :
    * UnrealSharp.ExportDatabase
    * UnrealSharp.ExportUnrealCppDatabase
    * UnrealSharp.ExportBlueprintDatabase
8. open GameScripts/UnrealSharp.sln, **[Select your development platform's Configuration](./Docs/CSharpBuildConfiguration.md)**, compile this solution.  
C# binding code and C++ interaction APIs will be automatically generated during the compilation process [if you enable this function]. 
9. If you enable C++ interactive code generation, you need to recompile your C++ code and start Unreal Editor again. The deployment is complete.   
10. The next thing you have to do is [learn how to](#turtorials) add C# code in C# according to the specifications to implement Unreal Class, Unreal Struct, Unreal Enums, etc.
